For the Customer object class, which has a string properties Name, ContactPhone and Revenue decimal type property, the ability to implement a string representation of various kinds.
For example, for an object with the values of Name = "Jeffrey Richter", Revenue = 1000000, ContactPhone = "+1 (425) 555-0100" can have the following options:

* Customer record: Jeffrey Richter, 1,000,000.00, +1 (425) 555-0100
* Customer record: +1 (425) 555-0100
* Customer record: Jeffrey Richter, 1,000,000.00
* Customer record: Jeffrey Richter
* Customer record: 1000000, etc.

Without changing the Customer class, adding to objects of this class additional ability to format not provided for the class. Develop unit tests.
